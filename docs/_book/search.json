In this workshop, we will explore the advanced features of the Nextflow language and runtime, and learn how to use them to write efficient and scalable data-intensive workflows. We will cover topics such as parallel execution, error handling, and workflow customization. Please note that this is not an introductory workshop, and we will assume some basic familiarity with Nextflow. By the end of this workshop, you will have the skills and knowledge to create complex and powerful Nextflow pipelines for your own data analysis projects. Let’s get started!"

    "text": "1.1 map\n\nBasics\nMap is certainly the most commonly used of the operators covered here. It’s a way to supply a closure through which each element in the channel is passed. The return value of the closure is emitted as an element in a new output channel. A canonical example is a closure that multiplies two numbers:\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )\n    | map { it * it }\n    | view\n}\n\nBy default, the element being passed to the closure is given the default name it. The variable can be named by using the -> notation:\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )\n    | map { num -> num * num }\n    | view\n}\n\nGroovy is an optionally typed language, and it is possible to specify the type of the argument passed to the closure.\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )\n    | map { Integer num -> num * num }\n    | view\n}\n\n\n\nNamed Closures\nIf you find yourself re-using the same closure multiple times in your pipeline, the closure can be named and referenced:\n\ndef squareIt = { Integer num -> num * num }\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )\n    | map( squareIt )\n    | view\n}\n\nIf you have these re-usable closures defined, you can compose them together.\n\ndef squareIt = { it * it }\ndef addTwo = { it + 2 }\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )\n    | map( squareIt >> addTwo )\n    | view\n}\n\nN E X T F L O W  ~  version 22.10.4\nLaunching `./main.nf` [jolly_lalande] DSL2 - revision: f3c3e751fe\n3\n6\n11\n18\n27\n\n\nThe above is the same as writing:\n\ndef squareIt = { it * it }\ndef addTwo = { it + 2 }\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )\n    | map( squareIt )\n    | map( addTwo )\n    | view\n}\n\nFor those inclined towards functional programming, you’ll be happy to know that closures can be curried:\n\ndef timesN = { multiplier, it -> it * multiplier }\ndef timesTen = timesN.curry(10)\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.of( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )\n    | map( timesTen )\n    | view\n}"

In the next chapter, we’ll discuss the “meta map” pattern in more detail, but we can preview that here.\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header: true )\n    | map { row -> \n        metaMap = [id: row.id, type: row.type, repeat: row.repeat]\n        [metaMap, [file(row.fastq1), file(row.fastq2)]]\n    }\n    | view\n}\n\nThe construction of this map is very repetitive, and in the next chapter, we’ll discuss some Groovy methods available on the Map class that can make this pattern more concise and less error-prone."

    "text": "1.5 branch\nIn the example above, the multiMap operator was necssary because we were supplied with a samplesheet that combined two pairs of fastq per row. If we were to use the neater samplesheet, we could use the branch operator to achieve the same result.\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header: true )\n    | map { row -> [[id: row.id, repeat: row.repeat, type: row.type], [file(row.fastq1), file(row.fastq2)]] }\n    | branch { meta, reads ->\n        tumor: meta.type == \"tumor\"\n        normal: meta.type == \"normal\"\n    }\n    | set { samples }\n\n    samples.tumor | view { \"Tumor: $it\"}\n    samples.normal | view { \"Normal: $it\"}\n}\n\nAn element is only emitted to the first channel were the test condition is met. If an element does not meet any of the tests, it is not emitted to any of the output channels. You can ‘catch’ any such samples by specifying true as a condition. If we knew that all samples would be either tumor or normal and no third ‘type’, we could write\n\nbranch { meta, reads ->\n    tumor: meta.type == \"tumor\"\n    normal: true\n}\n\nWe can optionally return a new element to one or more of the output channels. For example, to add an extra key in the meta map of the tumor samples, we add a new line under the condition and return our new element. In this example, we modify the first element of the List to be a new list that is the result of merging the existing meta map with a new map containing a single key:\n\nbranch { meta, reads ->\n    tumor: meta.type == \"tumor\"\n        return [meta + [newKey: 'myValue'], reads]\n    normal: true\n}\n\n\nExercise\nHow would you modify the element returned in the tumor channel to have the key:value pair type:'abnormal' instead of type:'tumor'?\n\n\nShow answer\n\nThere are many ways to accomplish this, but the map merging pattern introduced above can also be used to safely and concicely rename values in a map.\n\nbranch { meta, reads ->\n    tumor: meta.type == \"tumor\"\n        return [meta + [type: 'abnormal'], reads]\n    normal: true\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging maps is safe\n\n\n\nUsing the + operator to merge two or more Maps returns a new Map. There are rare edge cases where modification of map rather than returning a new map can affect other channels. We discuss this further in the next chapter, but just be aware that this + operator is safer and often more convenient than modifying the meta object directly.\nSee the Groovy Map documentation for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-channel Objects\nSome Nextflow operators return objects that contain multiple channels. The multiMap and branch operators are excellent examples. In most instances, the output is assigned to a variable and then addressed by name:\n\nnumbers = Channel.from(1,2,3,4,5) \n| multiMap {\n    small: it\n    large: it * 10\n}\nnumbers.small | view { num -> \"Small: $num\"}\nnumbers.large | view { num -> \"Large: $num\"}\n\nor by using set:\n\nChannel.from(1, 2, 3, 40, 50) \n| branch {\n    small: it\n    large: it * 10\n}\n| set { numbers }\n\nnumbers.small | view { num -> \"Small: $num\"}\nnumbers.large | view { num -> \"Large: $num\"}\n\nGiven a process that takes multiple channels\n\nprocess MultiInput {\n    debug true\n    input:\n    val(smallNum)\n    val(bigNum)\n\n    \"echo -n small is $smallNum and big is $bigNum\"\n}\n\nYou can either provide the channels individually:\n\nChannel.from(1,2,3,4,5) \n| multiMap {\n    small: it\n    large: it * 10\n}\n| set { numbers }\n\nMultiInput(numbers.small, numbers.large)\n\nor you can provide the multichannel as a single input:\n\nChannel.from(1,2,3,4,5) \n| multiMap {\n    small: it\n    large: it * 10\n}\n| set { numbers }\n\nMultiInput(numbers)\n\nThis also means you can skip the set operator for the cleanest solution:\n\nChannel.from(1,2,3,4,5) \n| multiMap {\n    small: it\n    large: it * 10\n}\n| MultiInput\n\nIf you have processes that output multiple channels and input multiple channels and the cardinality matches, they can be chained together in the same manner."

I’d like to start with a worst-case scenario where you’ve been handed a bag of files that you need to make sense of. We’ll use this example to introduce some helpful Groovy syntactic sugar and features that will be helpful in other Nextflow contexts.\nGiven a bag of fastq reads:\n\ncd chapter_02_metadata\ntree data/reads\n\ndata/reads/\n|-- treatmentA\n|   |-- sampleA_rep1_normal_R1.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleA_rep1_normal_R2.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleA_rep1_tumor_R1.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleA_rep1_tumor_R2.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleA_rep2_normal_R1.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleA_rep2_normal_R2.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleA_rep2_tumor_R1.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleA_rep2_tumor_R2.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleB_rep1_normal_R1.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleB_rep1_normal_R2.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleB_rep1_tumor_R1.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleB_rep1_tumor_R2.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleC_rep1_normal_R1.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleC_rep1_normal_R2.fastq.gz\n|   |-- sampleC_rep1_tumor_R1.fastq.gz\n|   `-- sampleC_rep1_tumor_R2.fastq.gz\n`-- treatmentB\n    |-- sampleA_rep1_normal_R1.fastq.gz\n    |-- sampleA_rep1_normal_R2.fastq.gz\n    |-- sampleA_rep1_tumor_R1.fastq.gz\n    `-- sampleA_rep1_tumor_R2.fastq.gz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWhomever has handed us these files has encoded metadata in both the filename, but also the name of the parent directories treatmentA and treatmentB.\n\n\n\nFirst Pass\nA first pass attempt at pulling these files into Nextflow might use the fromFilePairs method:\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromFilePairs(\"data/reads/*/*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz\")\n    | view\n}\n\nNextflow will pull out the first part of the fastq filename and returned us a channel of tuple elements where the first element is the filename-derived ID and the second element is a list of two fastq files.\nThe id is stored as a simple string. We’d like to move to using a map of key-value pairs because we have more than one piece of metadata to track. In this example, we have sample, replicate, tumor/normal, and treatment. We could add extra elements to the tuple, but this changes the ‘cardinality’ of the elements in the channel and adding extra elements would require updating all downstream processes. A map is a single object and is passed through Nextflow channels as one value, so adding extra metadata fields will not require us to change the cardinality of the downstream processes.\nThere are a couple of different ways we can pull out the metadata\nWe can use the tokenize method to split our id. To sanity-check, I just pipe the result directly into the view operator.\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromFilePairs(\"data/reads/*/*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz\")\n    | map { id, reads ->\n        tokens = id.tokenize(\"_\")\n    }\n    | view\n}\n\nIf we are confident about the stability of the naming scheme, we can destructure the list returned by tokenize and assign them to variables directly:\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    (sample, replicate, type) = id.tokenize(\"_\")\n    meta = [sample:sample, replicate:replicate, type:type]\n    [meta, reads]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructuring requires parentheses\n\n\n\nMake sure that you’re using a tuple with parentheses e.g. (one, two) rather than a List e.g. [one, two]\n\n\nAnother option is to use the transpose method with the collectEntries() to produce the same map. I’d warn that this method is bordering on a little ‘too clever’ and is more difficult to read. It also assumes that the order of the filename-encoded metadata is consistent.\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    meta = [id.tokenize(\"_\"), ['sample', 'replicate', 'type']]\n        .transpose()\n        .collectEntries()\n    [meta, reads]\n}\n\nIf we move back to the previous method, but decided that the ‘rep’ prefix on the replicate should be removed, we can use regular expressions to simply “subtract” pieces of a string. Here we remove a ‘rep’ prefix from the replicate variable if the prefix is present:\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    (sample, replicate, type) = id.tokenize(\"_\")\n    replicate -= ~/^rep/\n    meta = [sample:sample, replicate:replicate, type:type]\n    [meta, reads]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrim strings\n\n\n\nGroovy has a lot of very helpful syntactic sugar for string manipulation. You can trim parts of a string by simply subtracting another string:\n\ndemo = \"one two three\"\nassertEquals(demo - \"two \", \"one three\")\n\n… or by subtracting a regular expression:\n\ndemo = \"one two three\"\nassertEquals(demo - ~/t.o ?/, \"one three\")\n\nTo quickly sanity-check a groovy expression, try the Groovy web console\n\n\nWe are almost there, but the we still don’t have the “treatment” metadata captured in our meta map. The treament is encoded in this example in the name of the parent directory relative to the reads. Inside the map object, the reads are a list of two UnixPath objects. These objects implement the java.nio.Path interface, which provides us many useful methods, including getParent().\nWe can call the getParent() method on each of the paths like so:\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    reads.collect { it.getParent() }\n}\n\nIf we want to call a set method on every item in a Collection, Groovy provides this convenient “spread dot” notation:\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    reads*.getParent()\n}\n\nthis returns another Path object, but we only want the name of the last directory, so we need to call .getName() method on each of these Paths. We can use the spread-dot notation again:\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    reads*.getParent()*.getName()\n}\n\nThe last piece of Groovy sugar is to note that methods with get and set prefixes can be called with a property-style notation, converting getParent() to parent and getName() to name:\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    reads*.parent*.name\n}\n\nIf we wanted to remove the “treatment” prefix, we can combine this new notation with the “minus” method which we used earlier in the aliased - form.\n\nmap { id, reads ->\n    reads*.parent*.name*.minus(~/treatment/)\n}\n\nIn this particular example, we know ahead of time that the treatments must be the same because of the way the fromFilePairs method gathers pairs, but we’ll continue for the sake of the demonstration. Our final map closure might look like:\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromFilePairs(\"data/reads/*/*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz\")\n    | map { id, reads ->\n        (sample, replicate, type) = id.tokenize(\"_\")\n        (treatmentFwd, treatmentRev) = reads*.parent*.name*.minus(~/treatment/)\n        meta = [\n            sample:sample,\n            replicate:replicate,\n            type:type,\n            treatmentFwd:treatmentFwd,\n            treatmentRev:treatmentRev,\n        ]\n        [meta, reads]\n    }\n    | view\n}\n\nThis metadata map can be passed through the workflow with the reads and used to split, join and recombine the data. The resulting channel would be suitable for any Nextflow process with inputs of the form\n\nprocess ExampleProcess {\n    input:\n    tuple val(meta), path(reads)\n\n    // ...\n\nThis channel “shape” or cardinarlity is extremely common in nf-core modules and subworkflows and is criticial to enabling reusability of these modules."

    "text": "3.1 Grouping using subMap\nNow that we have a channel that conforms to the tuple val(meta) path(<something>) pattern, we can investigate splitting and grouping patterns.\nWe’ll start with a simple main.nf in the chapter_03_grouping directory\n\ncd chapter_03_grouping\n\n\n\n\nmain.nf\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header:true )\n    | map { row ->\n        meta = [id:row.id, repeat:row.repeat, type:row.type]\n        [meta, [\n            file(row.fastq1, checkIfExists: true), \n            file(row.fastq2, checkIfExists: true)]]\n    }\n    | view\n}\n\n\nThe first change we’re going to make is to correct some repetitive code that we’ve seen quite a lot already in this workshop. The construction of the meta map from this row stutters quite a lot. We can make use of the subMap method available Maps to quickly return a new map constructed from the subset of an existing map:\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header:true )\n    | map { row ->\n        meta = row.subMap('id', 'repeat', 'type')\n        [meta, [\n            file(row.fastq1, checkIfExists: true), \n            file(row.fastq2, checkIfExists: true)]]\n    }\n    | view\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete meta map safety\n\n\n\nThe subMap method will take a collection of keys and construct a new map with just the keys listed in the collection. This method, in combination with the plus or + method for combining maps and resetting values should allow all contraction, expansion and modification of maps safely.\n\n\n\nExercise\nCan you extend our workflow in an unsafe manner? Use the set operator to name the channel in our worflow above, and then map (the operator) over that without modification. In a separate map operation, try modifying the meta map in a way that is reflected in the first map.\nNote that we’re trying to do the wrong thing in this example to clarify what the correct approach might be.\n\n\nShow answer\n\nTo ensure that the modification of the map happens first, we introduce a sleep into the first map operation. This sleep emulates a long-running Nextflow process.\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header:true )\n    | map { row ->\n        meta = row.subMap('id', 'repeat', 'type')\n        [meta, [\n            file(row.fastq1, checkIfExists: true),\n            file(row.fastq2, checkIfExists: true)]]\n    }\n    | set { samples }\n\n    samples\n    | map { sleep 10; it }\n    | view { meta, reads -> \"Should be unmodified: $meta\" }\n    \n    samples\n    | map { meta, reads ->\n        meta.type = meta.type == \"tumor\" ? \"abnormal\" : \"normal\"\n        [meta, reads]\n    }\n    | view { meta, reads -> \"Should be modified: $meta\" }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExercise\nHow would you fix the example above to use the safe operators plus and subMap to ensure that the original map remains unmodified?\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\nworkflow {\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header:true )\n    | map { row ->\n        meta = row.subMap('id', 'repeat', 'type')\n        [meta, [\n            file(row.fastq1, checkIfExists: true),\n            file(row.fastq2, checkIfExists: true)]]\n    }\n    | set { samples }\n\n    samples\n    | map { sleep 10; it }\n    | view { meta, reads -> \"Should be unmodified: $meta\" }\n    \n    samples\n    | map { meta, reads ->\n        newmap = [type: meta.type == \"tumor\" ? \"abnormal\" : \"normal\"]\n        [meta + newmap, reads]\n    }\n    | view { meta, reads -> \"Should be modified: $meta\" }\n}"

If even one read mapping job takes a long time, the processing of all other samples is held up. We need a way of signalling to nextflow how many items are in a given group so that items can be emitted as early as possible.\nBy default, the groupTuple operator groups on the first item in the element, which at the moment is a Map. We can turn this map into a special class using the groupKey method, which takes our grouping object as a first parameter and the number of expected elements in the second parameter.\n\nMapReads( samples, reference )\n| map { meta, bam -> \n    key = groupKey(meta.subMap('id', 'type'), NUMBER_OF_ITEMS_IN_GROUP)\n    [key, bam]\n}\n| groupTuple\n| view \n\n\nExercise\nHow might we modify the upstream channels to the number of repeats into the metamap?\n\n\nShow answer\n\n\nworkflow {\n    reference = Channel.fromPath(\"data/genome.fasta\").first()\n\n    Channel.fromPath(\"data/samplesheet.csv\")\n    | splitCsv( header:true )\n    | map { row ->\n        meta = row.subMap('id', 'repeat', 'type')\n        [meta, [file(row.fastq1, checkIfExists: true), file(row.fastq2, checkIfExists: true)]]\n    }\n    | map { meta, reads -> [meta.subMap('id', 'type'), meta.repeat, reads] }\n    | groupTuple\n    | map { meta, repeats, reads -> [meta + [repeatcount:repeats.size()], repeats, reads] }\n    | transpose\n    | map { meta, repeat, reads -> [meta + [repeat:repeat], reads]}\n    | set { samples }\n    \n    MapReads( samples, reference )\n    | map { meta, bam -> \n        key = groupKey(meta.subMap('id', 'type'), meta.repeatcount)\n        [key, bam]\n    }\n    | groupTuple\n    | view \n}\n\n\nNow that we have our repeats together in an output channel, we can combine them using advanced bioinformatics<84>\n\nprocess CombineBams {\n    input:\n    tuple val(meta), path(\"input/in_*_.bam\")\n\n    output:\n    tuple val(meta), path(\"combined.bam\")\n\n    \"cat input/*.bam > combined.bam\"\n} \n\nIn our workflow:\n\nMapReads( samples, reference )\n| map { meta, bam -> \n    key = groupKey(meta.subMap('id', 'type'), meta.repeatcount)\n    [key, bam]\n}\n| groupTuple\n| CombineBams"
